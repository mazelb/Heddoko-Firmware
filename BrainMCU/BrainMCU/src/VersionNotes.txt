 VERSION 0.3c:
 1. Added in the changes according to the code review
 2. Changed bootloader to check for LBO (line: 68, bootloader.c)
 3. Changed for loop to execute till expected number of nods for scan and connect commands (line: 578, 645, tas_quinticInterface.c) 

 VERSION 0.3d:
 1. Added in the functionality to store the LED-GPIO mapping in the NVM settings
 2. Added in CR+LF at the end of imuSet string after it is loaded from settings file

 VERSION 0.4a
 1. Removed sleep mode for compatibility with new power board
 2. this is not a release version

 VERSION 0.4b
 1. Added #ifdef for compiling the code with the new powerboard
 2. Modified the STAT pin to be used for communication with the new power board. 
 3. Released as test version for new power board.  
 
 VERSION 0.4c
 1. Added multiple blinks and multi color functionality to the LED driver
 2. Added in SD-card size check in reloadConfigSettings function. The check prevents the system to enter Idle state if free space is below threshold (300MB).
 3. Added in dual events on Reset button. Long press enters the system to reset state, single press marks the data row at that instant in movement 
    log with appended "BTN" text.

 VERSION 0.4d
 1. Added in changes in stateEntryPowerDown() for fast boot-up.
 2. Removed bug from SD-card size check function, THIS MAKES THE VERSION 0.4C A NON-RELEASE VERSION.
 3. Added in necessary calls for opening debug log file to statemachine.c.
 4. Added in vTaskDelay inside while loop of reloadConfigSettings() to let it service timers.

 VERSION 0.4e
 1. Added in changes to gpio driver for setting SD-CD interrupt type as per current state of pin.
 2. Added few more debugPrints on QuinticInit task.
 3. Added a call to reload config settings on reset button press if the settings weren't loaded previously.
 4. Added in compile time condition to not have interrupts on Jack OC and DC if using new power board.
 5. Removed the reset of Quintics while powering up. However the 100ms delay is kept as remving it makes the system go to error directly.

 VERSION 0.4f (for fun!)
 1. Added critical regions for the putChar function calls. 
 2. Added sending of command character to Brain Pack to indicate that the Jacks must be toggled 

 VERSION 0.4g (for great!) 
 1. Changed debug log filename to sysHdk.bin 

 VERSION 0.4h (for Heddoko! INDEED)
 1. Added in a 500ms delay in the EnterReset() function before spawning the Quintic init task to get rid of miss on responses.

 VERSION 0.4i (for integrity!)
 1. Added in a bug fix in GPIO driver in enabling peripheral clock

 VERSION 0.4j (for jolly!)
 1. Added in request for time command from the power board. 
 2. Added fix for first frame issue, where recording first frame can contain data from last recording
 3. Added in header with timestamp, fw version, and serial number to the recording files to track when the file was created. 

 VERSION 0.4k (for king!)
 1. Added semaphore for writting data to command UART, to solve issue with corrupt stream. 

 VERSION 0.4l (for lookup!)
 2. Changed the semaphore wait time in debugLogWriteEntry from 5 to 10
 3. CheckRtosStack is only done when debug prints are enabled.
 4. Introduced a check on debug log buffer copy, Concatenates if the previous data was not written to Sd card.
 5. Changed the printf to debugPrint for the line "debug sync failed with code %d\r\n" .
